        <para> Constituents that are labeled only at the word level (i.e., verbs) conjoin at the
            word level. When an active verb is conjoined with a middle-passive verb, the appropriate
            verbal POS tag with an -X appended is used to show that the voice of the conjoined verb
            is unknown. It is not possible to conjoin—at the word level—two verbs that are marked
            differently for tense (or aspect). See <xref linkend="unlike_conj"/> for what to do in
            this situation. <itemizedlist>

            <para> However, because of the prevalence of introducing direct speech with the
                participle λέγων in the GNT, conjoined direct speech embedded within participial or

                introduced by a verb of saying in a matrix clause: all conjoined clauses containing
                direct speech after the first one are treated as separate tokens.

            <para> Because of the way that we split matrix clauses, shared elements interpreted as
                belonging to both clauses must be annotated as belonging to one clause or the other,
                or one of the clauses must be treated as parenthetical. For adjuncts, we take the
                former approach (see examples below); for complements, the latter (see <xref
                    linkend="embedded_conj"/>). As a result of our convention, pre-sentential
                adjuncts (most commonly, clause-initial WHEN and IF clauses) appear as constituents
                of the first conjunct only, while post-sentential adjuncts appear as constituents of
