                    <para>Our primary goal has been to create an annotation system that facilitates
                        automated searches, not to give a correct linguistic analysis of each
                        sentence. For instance, if a construction can be found unambiguously through
                        a combination of properties of a bracketed sentence, our annotation may not
                        contain all of the structure that a full phrase structure diagram of the
                        sentence would have.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>We have tried to plan our system so that at each stage of the annotation,
                        information is added in a monotonic way. In particular, we want any future
                        revisions of the bracketed structures always to add information, never to
                        change it. This goal requires us to avoid subjective judgments since they
                        are extremely error-prone. So, for example, we do not distinguish object
                        control from E(xceptional) C(ase) M(arking), nor do we attempt to implement
                        the argument-adjunct distinction (except where we have decided to make our
                        annotation similar to the annotation of the <link

                        annotation of DP modifiers of DPs).</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>As many categories as possible should have clear meanings so that unclear
                        cases can be relegated to a small number of categories of residual cases.
                        The price of making most categories homogeneous is that these residual
                        categories will not be. In future revisions of the corpus, it may be
                        possible to divide some of these residual categories into homogeneous
                        subcategories.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>As much as possible, we have avoided making decisions that would be
                        controversial, whether with regard to text interpretation or to linguistic
                        theory. In doubtful cases, we either avoid specifying structure, or we use
                        default rules to decide the case for search purposes. An example of the
                        first strategy concerns VPs. These are not indicated in the corpus, since VP
                        boundaries are normally indeterminate. This is clearly the case in Classical
                        and New Testament Greek, which allow scrambling and where the internal
                        structure of the VP is variable and changing. Even in modern English there
                        are many cases in which it is not clear whether some phrase attaches as a
                        daughter of VP or higher up in the tree. An example of the second strategy
                        concerns PP attachment. Whenever it is unclear where a PP attaches, we
                        attach it by default as high as possible.</para>

            <para>Part-of-speech (POS) tagged texts have the extension .pos\index{files!.pos files}.
                They contain the material in the text files with a POS tag added to each word.
                Editorial material including milestones (e.g., chapter and verse numbers in the
                format chapter:verse) is given the tag CODE. Text elements are separated from their
                POS tags by an underscore. The text is divided into tokens in the same way as in the
                text files.</para>

            <title>Parsed Files (.psd)</title>
            <para>Parsed files have the extension .psd. They contain a labeled bracketing of the
                text, with the first set of labeled parentheses around a word repeating the
                information from the POS-tagged files. The division into tokens in the parsed files
                is the same as in the POS files. Each token is enclosed with its ID in a set of
                unlabeled parentheses. <programlisting>
