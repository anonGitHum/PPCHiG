        <title>Syntax for Splitting Words</title>
        <para> There are two syntaxes for splitting words. The first applies only in cases of
            crasis, while the second is the default applying in every other case.<itemizedlist>

                            <para>Components are split according to the logical division between
                                words, with the leftmost component word containing all breathing
                                marks. The leftmost component word ends with @, and the rightmost
                                component word starts with @. In the case that three (or more) words
                                are combined due to crasis, the middle word(s) would have @ both
                                prefixed and suffixed to the word.</para>
