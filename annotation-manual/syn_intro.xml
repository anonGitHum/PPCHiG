    <para> The parsing scheme for the PPCHiG, which is also used by the <link
            xlink:href="Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English">Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical
            English</link>, uses a limited tree representation in the form of labeled parentheses.
        All open parentheses have an associated label, either a phrase label (NP, ADJP, etc.) or a
        word label (N, ADJ, etc.), representing nodes in a tree. We use the terms `word label' and
        `POS (part-of-speech) label' interchangeably. A word label is associated with every word,
        but phrasal labels are not included in every case in which a fully labeled tree would
        require them. Intermediate projections in the sense of X' theory (N', ADJ', etc.) are not
        generally included in our representations. By comparison to trees in current syntactic
        theory, the trees in our corpora are therefore quite flat, and they are not required to be
        binary-branching. </para>
    <para> The partial representation of phrase structure in our corpora is not intended to make a
        theoretical statement, but was adopted for practical reasons. Certain phrases are generally
        omitted in the annotation scheme because their boundaries are too difficult to define. The
        prime example is VP. The problematic character of VP is particularly obvious in early Middle
        English, where the order of the verb and its complements is in flux (at least on the
        surface). But even in Present-Day English, the attachment site of verbal adjuncts is
        systematically ambiguous between low attachment to VP and high attachment at the clause
        level. Other categories, such as DP, were omitted because the cost of including them
        outweighs their usefulness. Intermediate projections are omitted for both reasons. In no
        case should the lack of any particular phrase label be taken to imply that earlier forms of
        Greek failed to include the corresponding syntactic category. The trees in the corpora are
        simply underspecified. </para>
    <para> The examples in this section of the manual are constructed in Modern English so as to be
        maximally accessible. The remainder of the manual contains examples from the corpora. The
        examples are mostly from New Testament Greek (NTG); examples from Herodotus and Homer will
        be added later. </para>

        <para> As just mentioned, the structures in our corpora generally include neither a VP nor
            intermediate projections like I'. As a result, IP immediately dominates all verbs (to be
            understood in a broad sense, including modals and auxiliaries) and sentence-level
            constituents. A typical parse structure is the following:

                        In general, phrase labels indicate a constituent's category (NP, PP, ADJP,
                        etc.). Additional labels (so-called dash tags), which are separated from the
                        category label by a hyphen, indicate subcategory or function: <itemizedlist>

                    <para> In general, the head of a phrase is overt and matches the category of the
                        phrase, but in certain cases, there is no matching head. Sometimes, this is
                        simply an artifact of our annotation scheme and due to the fact that some
                        words receive a more specific label than others. For instance, pronouns are
                        labeled PRO, not D or N. In other instances, the absence of an overt head
                        reflects the possibility of some deletion process. The most common type of
                        categorial mismatch between heads and phrases is nominal elements not
                        labeled N, NS, etc.: PRO, CLPRO, CLQ(?), D(?), Q(?). As indicated by the
                        question marks in the above list, it is not always clear whether a
                        particular word modifies an elided head or is itself the head of the phrase.
                        It is mainly for this reason that we do not attempt to make a systematic
                        distinction between the two cases. The most common elision case is of NPs
                        containing only a determiner and an adjective (or sometimes only an
                        adjective).
